I enjoy doing some of the word puzzles in the New York Times Magazine every week. The thing is, I'm not very good at solving some of these word puzzles. However, the New York Times can't defeat me that easily. So I've written some python scripts to solve these puzzles for me, and it's technically not cheating because I technically did solve the puzzle myself, without looking at the answers. The first one is for a game called Spelling Bee, and the second (coming soon) is for Split Decisions. Their respective readmes will have details about the game, its rules, and other information about the runtime and other relevant computer science information.
